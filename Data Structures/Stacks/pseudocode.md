# Pseudocode
Encompasses two classes, ```Node()``` and ```Tree()```


## ```Node``` 
Each node has three attributes, ```val```, ```next```.

## ```Stack```
A Stack has two attributes, ```top``` and a ```size```.

## Tasks
Create the following methods:
1. ```push``` - Push a value to the stack.
2. ```pop``` - Remove a value from the stack.
3. ```peek``` - View the topmost element of the stack.
4. ```isEmpty``` - Returns true if the stack is empty.
5. ```size``` - Returns the size of the stack.
6. ```printStack``` - Print the elements in the stack.

Create a stack using your ```push``` function, implement a way to _print_ it, and successfully call all methods properly, showing accurate usage of them with your printing function. 

### Clarifications
```pass``` is inputed to avoid errors. It is not appropriate code and should not remain in your working methods.
