# Pseudocode

A graph consists of vertices connected by edges.

## `Graph` class

A graph object is mapped to a data structure representing its structure.

## Tasks

Implement the following `Graph` class methods:

- `add_edge()` creates the graph.
- `bfs()` which performs the traversal and prints the verticies visited in BFS order.

You will include the parameters you find fitting to implement BFS.

## Appendix

You are allowed the following imports to assist you:

- `collections` -> { `defaultdict`, `deque` }
- `typing` -> { `List`, `set` }
